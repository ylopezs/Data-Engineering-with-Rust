/*
This code starts with an initial VecDeque,
converts it to a Vec for shuffling, and then converts it back to a VecDeque.
After that, it pushes "Pomegranate" to the front of the deque, and "Fig" and "Cherry"
to the back of the deque. Finally, it prints out the final fruit salad.

A VecDeque is a double-ended queue, which means that you can push and pop from both ends
of the queue.
*/

//TODO
/*
Challenge Questions:

    Can you modify the program to allow the user to add fruits to either end of the queue after shuffling?

    The SliceRandom trait provides a method choose(&self, rng: &R) -> Option<&T>. Can you use this to select a random fruit from the salad?

    Can you adjust the program to remove a fruit from either end of the queue, displaying the name of the removed fruit and the state of the queue afterwards?
